minifier-maven-plugin
=====================

What is this?
-------------
This project provides a Maven plugin to do one thing: safely "minify"
web resources. The key word is "safely": the aim is _not_ to produce
maximal size reduction, nor introduce any morphological changes, but
to provide _reasonable_ file size reduction in most cases.

References
----------
Minification is handled by Logic Squad's [Minifier](https://github.com/logicsquad/minifier)
project. This project is inspired by [Minify Maven Plugin](https://github.com/samaxes/minify-maven-plugin),
though aims to be a simpler product.
